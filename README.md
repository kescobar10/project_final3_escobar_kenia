## Resources

* JavaScript: Back to top using the onScroll function, using W3 schools as a guide to code my own (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)
* JQuery: Smoothscroll. I used [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/dWzGox) as an inspiration but I customized it to implement on my page.
* jQuery: .html() function to replace a paragraph with an h4. When clicking on the code button, a discount code replaces the paragraph above it.
* Plugin 1: [Backstretch](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/) to fill the header div with a responsive background image
* Plugin 2: [Fresco Lightbox](http://www.frescojs.com/) to display the Cake Gallery
* Plugin 3: [Fit Text](http://fittextjs.com/) to make the h2 and h3 responsive. I used this plugin for my Resume project but I liked how it helped with heading sizing so I used it again here.

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and the syllabus.

## Comments

We're done! It's been a great class and I feel so much more confident than I did at the beginning of the semester. Thanks, Lauren!

Also, I could not for the life of me get the nav bar to center. I gave up. I'm sorry.
